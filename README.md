# Electra-Vote
It is online voting system with face ditection created by RupX Lab
✨ Overview
ElectraVote is a secure, decentralized online voting system that integrates deep learning-based facial recognition for voter authentication. This project addresses critical challenges in traditional voting systems by providing a secure, accessible, and fraud-resistant digital voting platform.

**🎯 What Problem Does It Solve?
Traditional voting systems suffer from:**

✅ Security Vulnerabilities - Impersonation, duplicate voting

✅ Accessibility Issues - Remote voters, elderly, disabled individuals

✅ High Operational Costs - Paper ballots, polling stations, manpower

✅ Slow Results - Manual counting delays
